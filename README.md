# Personnal_data_storage  ðŸ’¾
A Personnal data management system. The purpose of this project is to apply the concept of graph theory in real world application. In this project, we are going to manipulate data using graph structure and build the most optimized data management system (based on the following guidelines). 

## Description
The graph is composed of data (with a size), several system nodes (container of data, with a limited capacity), users (interested in certain data and can only access these data).

### Guidelines:
- A user can only comminucate with ONE system node
- A system node can communicate with several users and system nodes
- Several user can be interested in the same data
- There are communication time between two elements (system node/user)
- data has to be stored in the closest system node (in time) from the user.
